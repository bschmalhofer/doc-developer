Documentation
=============

From OTRS 7 the documentations are available in *reStructuredText* format, that replaced the old *DocBook* format. Various outputs are available on the `OTRS documentation page <https://doc.otrs.com/doc/index.html>`__, like HTML, EPUB and PDF.

The documentation is written in English and translated into many languages.
