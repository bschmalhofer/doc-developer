Translating
===========

The translations are contributed and maintained mainly by OTRS users, so *your* help is needed.

All translations of the OTRS GUI, the public extension modules and the documentations are managed using `Weblate <https://translate.otrs.com/>`__.

To contribute to translations:

1. Sign up for a free translator account on `Weblate <https://translate.otrs.com/>`__.
2. Select a translation component and your language for translation.
3. Start updating your translation. No additional software or files required.

.. note::

   If your language is not listed in the dashboard, you can request a language. After it is approved, you can start translating.

From OTRS 7 the documentations are available in *reStructuredText* format, that replaced the old *DocBook* format. Be careful not to break the structure while translating the documentation.

.. seealso::

   You can find some examples in the :doc:`../documentation` chapter.

The OTRS developers will download the translations from time to time into the OTRS source code repositories, you don't have to submit them anywhere.
